This R shiny App let's you analyse your Portfolio or single stocks. You can save your created portfolio into a CSV File and upload it later again. The App will create several plots on: 
- Industry / country exposure 
- Portfolio: 
    -  Return
    -  Growth
    -  CAPM model
    - Adjusted returns (Ra) and baseline return (rb)
- Single Stocks:
    - Return
    - CAPM Model
    - Adjusted returns (Ra) and baseline return (rb)
    
_Note_ that a CAPM model uses several assumption that often do not hold in reality. (If yo are interest on that topic i recommend this [article](https://hbr.org/1982/01/does-the-capital-asset-pricing-model-work) by David W. Mullins, Jr.)
